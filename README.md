# EDA-for-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Overview

#### Customer churn analysis using Python:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science process that involves investigating datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It is a way to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, frame hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization tools. And Customer churn analysis focuses on identifying the reasons why customers stop using a product or service. Churn, or customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
